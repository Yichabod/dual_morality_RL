                Welcome! Please read these instructions carefully - this will help you earn more money by doing the task right. <br>  
                <br>
                In this task you are the director of a transport station. Unfortunately the station is usually chaotic - the freight is often not where it is supposed to be.  Sometimes it might even get hit by a train. <br>
                <br>
                You have three main goals:
                <ol><b>
                <li>Try to move the freight onto its target locations</li>
                <li>Try not to let the train hit the freight</li>
                <li>Try not to let the train hit you</li></b>
                </ol><br>
                Rarely will you be able to accomplish all of these goals in the limited time you have.  You have to prioritize to get as much done as you can.

            <div id="buttonbar">
                <button type="button" id='next'; onclick="clickStart('info1','info2');"; >NEXT</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="info2" style="display:none"> 
                <div id="instructions">
                Let's begin by looking at how the freight transport station is arranged.  In each trial you will see a screen like this:
                <br><br>
                <img src="assets/sample.png" id="centerimg">
                <br><br>
                This is you: <img src="assets/player.png" id="samples">
                <br><br>
                These are pieces of freight: <img src="assets/freight.png" id="samples">
                <br> 
                The piece labelled <q>$$</q> is more valuable, and the piece labelled <q>$</q> is less valuable.
                <br><br>
                This is a train: <img src="assets/train1.png" id="samples">
                <br>
                The train's orientation tells you which way it is moving. <br><br>
                This is a switch that allows you to change the direction that the train is moving in: <img src="assets/switch.png" id="samples">
                <br> The train will turn left, or counterclockwise, each time you hit the switch.
                <br><br>
                You will only have five moves in each round.  That's not very many, but usually it is enough time to do one or two useful things.

            <div id="instructions">
                In order to move around the freight transfer station you can use the  up, down, left, right, and space keys. The arrow keys move you in the directions indicated.  The <b>SPACE key allows you to stay in place for one move</b>. So, if you don't want to do anything but you still have some of your turns left, just hit the space bar as many times as you'd like.
                <br><br>

                Again, each round ends only after you have made <b>5 moves</b>.

If you move the cargo labeled <q>$$</q> onto its location you get 2 points.  If you move the cargo labeled <q>$</q> onto its location you get 1 point.

                Go ahead and give it a try!<br><br> You may move on when you have finished <b>5 steps</b> and put all the cargo in their target locations.

                As we mentioned, there is usually a train moving through the depot.
                <b>Every time you make a move (or push the spacebar), the train moves forward as well.   
                You want to avoid having the train hit you or the cargo.

                <br><br>
                You lose 2 points if the train hits the <q>$$</q> cargo. You lose 1 point if the train hits the <q>$</q> cargo.  
                You lose 4 points if the train hits you (and you will not be able to make any more moves during that round).

                In a moment we want you to try out some of this on the grid below.  We have two specific tasks listed for you. Complete each of these tasks one by one, pressing "n" at the end of each round to reset the board. When you've completed both the tasks and had the chance to learn a how this board works, move on.

                Try turning the train by flipping the switch.
                There is no cargo for you to worry about here - your only job is to learn how to turn the train.

                Remember that your goal is to <b>get the highest score possible for each grid. 
                You will receive bonus money based on the total number of points you accumulate by the end of the task.</b>
                <br><br>
                Also remember that you will rarely be able to accomplish everything you want to in the time you have, so you need to prioritize. It is ok if you cannot do everything within the limited steps you have. The train depot is chaotic, and you should try to get as many points as you can given the situation.
                <br><br>
                Go ahead and try a practice round before we move on to the real task. You must get the best score to move on.
